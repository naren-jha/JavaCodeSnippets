Using RedisTemplate with different data types as key - 
RedisTemplate can be used with several different data types as the key, including string, long, and various primitive types. Here are some examples of using different data types as keys with RedisTemplate:

**String:**

```Java
RedisTemplate<String, SomeObject> template;

// Set a value with a string key
template.opsForValue().set("key", new SomeObject(...));

// Get the value with the string key
SomeObject value = template.opsForValue().get("key");

```

**Long:**
```Java
RedisTemplate<Long, SomeObject> template;

// Set a value with a long key
template.opsForValue().set(123456L, new SomeObject(...));

// Get the value with the long key
SomeObject value = template.opsForValue().get(123456L);

```

**Integer:**
```Java
RedisTemplate<Integer, SomeObject> template;

// Set a value with an integer key
template.opsForValue().set(123, new SomeObject(...));

// Get the value with the integer key
SomeObject value = template.opsForValue().get(123);
```

You can also use other data types, such as byte arrays, as keys with RedisTemplate. Keep in mind that the data type you use as the key should match the data type you use when accessing the value later on.


**UserDefined Object:**
You can also use a user-defined object as a key with RedisTemplate. However, you will need to implement the hashCode() and equals() methods for your object in order for RedisTemplate to properly store and retrieve the values associated with your keys.

Here is an example of using a user-defined object as a key with RedisTemplate:

```Java
public class MyKey {
  private final String field1;
  private final int field2;

  public MyKey(String field1, int field2) {
    this.field1 = field1;
    this.field2 = field2;
  }

  public String getField1() {
    return field1;
  }

  public int getField2() {
    return field2;
  }

  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    // Implement hashCode() method
  }

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    // Implement equals() method
  }
}

RedisTemplate<MyKey, SomeObject> template;

// Set a value with a MyKey key
template.opsForValue().set(new MyKey("hello", 123), new SomeObject(...));

// Get the value with the MyKey key
SomeObject value = template.opsForValue().get(new MyKey("hello", 123));
```

In this example, we define a MyKey class that has two fields: field1 and field2. We implement the hashCode() and equals() methods in MyKey so that RedisTemplate can properly store and retrieve the values associated with keys of this type. We then use an instance of MyKey as the key when setting and getting values with RedisTemplate.


**Can we use a List or Set as key in Redis?**

You can't.

RedisTemplate does not support using a list or set as a key because these data types do not have a fixed size and can change over time, which makes them unsuitable for use as keys. In Redis, keys are used to access values in the database, so the key must be a fixed-size value that does not change over time.

However, you can use RedisTemplate to store and retrieve values that are lists or sets. Here is an example of using a list as the value with RedisTemplate:

```Java
RedisTemplate<String, List<SomeObject>> template;

// Create a list of SomeObjects
List<SomeObject> valueList = new ArrayList<>();
valueList.add(new SomeObject(...));
valueList.add(new SomeObject(...));

// Set the list as the value with a string key
template.opsForValue().set("key", valueList);

// Get the list of SomeObjects
List<SomeObject> retrievedList = template.opsForValue().get("key");
```

In this example, we use a string as the key and a list of SomeObject instances as the value. We set the list as the value using the string key, and then we retrieve the list of SomeObjects using the same string key.

You can use a similar approach to store and retrieve sets as values with RedisTemplate. Just replace the List type with the Set type in the code above. Keep in mind that you cannot use a set or list as the key with RedisTemplate.
